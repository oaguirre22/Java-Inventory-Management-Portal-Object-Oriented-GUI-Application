# Java Inventory Management Portal – Object-Oriented GUI Application

## Overview

This project is a desktop application developed in Java using Swing for its graphical user interface. It implements an inventory management system for automobile-type products and follows object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and interface implementation.

## Features

- Add and register vehicle products with attributes such as brand, model, year, and stock.
- Visual product type selection using image-based buttons.
- Display of current inventory with checkbox selection.
- Removal of selected items from inventory.
- Export inventory data to a formatted text report.
- Input validation with appropriate user alerts.
- Modular class design and code readability.
- Includes UML diagram for system architecture understanding.

## Project Structure

- `Producto.java`: Interface defining base behavior for products.
- `Automovil.java`: Class implementing the `Producto` interface.
- `TipoProducto.java`: Subclass with name validation and additional overrides.
- `PortalInventarios.java`: Main GUI class with event handling and layout logic.
- `UML_LuisyOscar.pdf`: UML diagram representing class relationships.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- IDE or compiler that supports Java and GUI libraries (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)

## Execution

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `PortalInventarios.java` file.
4. Interact with the interface to add, view, and manage product data.

## Authors
